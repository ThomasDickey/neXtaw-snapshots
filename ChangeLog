2015/01/07
	+ eliminate NeedFunctionPrototypes and NeedWideFunctionPrototypes
	  ifdefs
	+ use shared-library autoconf macros from cdk/dialog/ncurses.
	+ purge automake from build-scripts.
	+ reformatted this file, to help with metrics-gathering.
	+ updated config.guess, config.sub, install-sh

2003/09/15
	> updates by Ulric Eriksson:
	+ Toggle again: the check mark displayed in the wrong place
	  when the widget wasn't its default height.
	+ Added code to the Command Redisplay function so it doesn't
	  shift the text when the widget is a Toggle in check or radio
	  style. That's really ugly because we're depending
	  on how the widget is subclassed. But it works.

2003/09/13
	> updates by Ulric Eriksson:
	  The new highlighting code broke with the Toggle widget
	  in radio or check style.

2003/09/12
	> updates by Ulric Eriksson:
	+ Fixed function prototypes in Toggle.c and fixed bugs
	  caused by not having them in the first place.

2003/09/03
	> updates by Ulric Eriksson:
	+ Eliminated warnings caused by missing #includes.

2003/09/02
	> updates by Ulric Eriksson:
	+ Scrollbar: Added XtNarrowStyle resource to make arrows in the
	  style of Windows ("win95") or NeXt ("next", default).
	  UPDATE: This was later backed out.

2003/09/02
	> updates by Ulric Eriksson:
	+ Scrollbar: Made the bump on the thumb optional (resource
	  XtNdrawBump, default True).

2003/09/01
	> updates by Ulric Eriksson:
	+ ThreeD: Added XtNbevel resource to make the bevel "solid"
	  (Motif/Xaw3d-like) or "rounded" (neXtaw, default).
	+ Added the same code to neXtawDrawShadowBox in Misc.c, which
	  is used by Scrollbar and SimpleMenu.
	+ Added a 3D bevel to Text using a similar hack as in Xaw95.

2003/08/31
	> updates by Ulric Eriksson:
	+ Command, Repeater and Toggle: Draw a dotted rectangle around
	  the highlighted widget. Reduced the distance the text shifts
	  in a set widget to 1 pixel.

2003/08/24
	> updates by Ulric Eriksson:
	+ Added traversal code from Ed Falk's XawM. Note: KDE messes up
	  translations for the Command widget. That is a bug in KDE.

2003/08/23
	> updates by Ulric Eriksson:
	+ Released 0.14.1.

2003/08/23
	> patch from Alexey I Froloff <raorn@altlinux.ru>:
	+ This patch adds shadow width to SimpleMenu widget's height
	  (last Sme overlaps with bottom shadow) and fixes SmeBSB drawing
	  code (different regions were highlighted in Redisplay and
	  FlipColors, "disabled" menu items were displayed as normal if
	  .international is set to True).

2003/02/27
	> updates by Ulric Eriksson:
	+ Updated selection code in Text widget.
	+ Removed support for cut buffers.
	+ Added support for CLIPBOARD.
	+ Changed keybindings:
	  Ctrl-C = copy selection to clipboard
	  Ctrl-X = cut selection to clipboard
	  Ctrl-V = paste clipboard
	  Page_Up = page up
	  Page_Down = page down
	  Home = beginning of line
	  Ctrl-Home = beginning of file
	  End = end of line
	  Ctrl-End = end of file
	+ New configuration option --enable-obsolete-selections reverts
	  to the old code.

2003/02/04
	> updates by Ulric Eriksson:
	  Check for the existence of widec.h (c/o Matthias Buelow).

2003/01/15
	> updates by Ulric Eriksson:
	+ Released 0.13.0.
	> patches by Alexey I Froloff:
	+ "NeXtish" scrollbar look (thumb and buttons are wider and

	+ Fixed thumb positioning for Button2 scrolling.

2002/08/28
